# cryptid-solver

Quick and dirty "solver" for a board game Cryptid.

It checks the initial board state and tries to provide one answer from combination of clues.

At its current state, it can't actually solve the puzzle but rather find one answer for multiple sets of clues. In other words, one initial board state can have multiple answers, depending on clues.

## Notes

The main script file is total mess, horrible spaghetti code at its current state. I may clean it up a bit at some point.
